# Security Policy

## Data Collection
DCX does not collect, store, or process any personal data from users. The project operates solely on the local machine and interacts only with the Android device connected via ADB, with no data transmission to external servers or third parties.

## Privacy
Your privacy is important. DCX does not require any personal information to function. It operates in a secure environment on your local system and does not access any personal data on your Android device unless explicitly instructed by the user.

## Security Measures
- **No data logging**: The tool does not log or store any user actions or device data.
- **No external connections**: DCX does not communicate with any external servers, ensuring your data remains private.
- **Local execution**: All commands are executed locally on your machine, with no information being sent over the internet.

## Responsibility
By using DCX, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any actions taken on your device. Please understand the purpose of this project and do not apply any settings that you are unfamiliar with, as this may lead to faster battery drain or reduced stability of your device. The developer is not responsible for any issues or damages caused by applying settings that you do not fully understand.

## Updates and Maintenance
Security updates, if necessary, will be provided through the GitHub repository. Users are encouraged to regularly check for updates to ensure the tool remains secure and functional.
