 **Introduction**
-----

Hello, Hunghoabinh here.
Welcome To My Project, A Small Project To Keep Low-end , Mid-range Devices Have Better Experience Due Downgrades Overtime.

--------------------
> What This Project Can Do? Can It Make My Phone Run Faster Or Gaming Experience Will Be Alot Better Than Before ❔



▶️Well Yes , But Not To Much.

Basically, This Scripts Will Optimize Your Devices With ADB Command , Which Don't Need To Root

This Scripts Have At Least 28 Settings That You Can Change It If You Want  

This Scripts Don't Have Any "Setprop For Gaming or Setprop For Ultra FPS woo hoo" , It Just Some Normal ADB Command That I Tested It And I Feel Safe To Use, So I Put Them In, Yet Its Still Work!! (Source : Trust Me Bro 👀)

Anyways, Don't Put Your Hope Into This Scripts Much ,Like It Will Gonna Become Flagship Devices.
